Logical piggybacking is an attempt to gain access through someone who has the rights, e.g., electronically attaching to an authorized telecom munication link to possibly intercept transmissions.

Viruses are malicious program code inserted into another executable code that can self -replicate and spread from computer to computer via sharing of com puter diskettes, transfer of logic over telecommunication lines, or direct contact with an infected machine.

Any such information, if stored, should be encrypted or protected by other means to avoid the possibility of unau thorized disclosure. Manually inputting sale invoices into the accounting application is an operational issue. The nonavailability of optical scanners to read bar codes of the products and power outages are also operational issues but do not pose the same level of risk as unencrypted credit card information."

    "options": {},
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "After implementing a disaster recovery plan, operational costs are likely to increase . This is because maintaining a disaster recovery plan typically involves ongoing costs such as maintaining backup systems, acquirin g additional resources (e.g., hardware, software, or off -site facilities), and training staff. While these costs help mitigate the impact of a disaster, they often result in higher operational expenses both before and after a disaster occurs. QUESTI ON 958 Which of the following is the MOST reasonable option for recovering a noncritical system?  Warm site  Mobile site  Hot site  Cold site Correct Answer: D Section: BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER RECOVERY Explanation: A cold site is the most reasonable o ption for recovering a noncritical system. Cold sites are typically less expensive and offer the basic infrastructure (such as space and power) needed to get systems up and running, but they do not have pre -configured equipment or systems in place. For non critical systems, which do not require immediate or highly available recovery, a cold site provides a cost -effective solution without the need for more expensive options like hot or warm sites."

It is important, however, that those systems which are essential to the busi ness are tested, and that the other systems are eventually tested throughout the year. One aim of the test is to identify and replace defective devices so that all systems can be replaced in the case of a disaster. Choice B would only be a concern if the n umber of discovered problems is systematically very high; in a real disaster, there is no need for a clean shutdown of the original production environment since the first priority is to bring the backup site up."
